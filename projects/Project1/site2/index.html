			<p>I work as a Diesel Mechanic and I do everything from swapping engines to rebuilding transmissions in semi trucks. At 3 years old I was able to change a tire on a car and at age 5 I started with my dad fixing semi trucks. I work with my dad and I will be taking over his business. I work everyday including weekends and I enjoy fixing diesel trucks. Aneta and I are actually big Blackhawks Fans and we try to watch every game. We both are Blackhawks Fanatics and we met several of the players. I am also a SCCA (Sports Car Club of America) Racecar Driver. My racecar is a 700hp Shelby GT 500 that I brought my self back when I was a senior in High School. I built the car from the ground up and I have a lot of work done to it. I beat many Ferraris, Corvetees, Lamborghinis on the track. This is a little about me and I hope to learn a lot in HTML!</p>
