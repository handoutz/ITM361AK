		<h3>My Soon to be Wife and Future Medical Psychiatrist</h3>
		<p>My soon to be wife Aneta is the one who inspired me to be the best. I met her when in high school and we instatly connected. She is much stronger then me when it comes to weightlifting. I am her coach and she is the best wife a person can ask for. She is very intertested in studying Psychiatry and Psychology. She just recently got accepted into Rush University and will be continuing her education in a very prestigious medical school. I help her study hard and always talk to her about my problems that I face and she always share me ideas on becoming a better person than I used to be. Since I am learning HTML I promised to make her resume online on github stand out so she can acheive everything.</p>
