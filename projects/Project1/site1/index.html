<h3>The Advantages of using Git Command</h3>
	<p>Using the Git commands or seeing a terminal will be hard for a lot of people. In reality using the git commands and the bash terminal to commit and push chnages is very easy to do. Also if you learn to do git the hard way then you become more skilled in porgramming and coding. You teach yourself to type faster and to make less mistakes since it is all casesensitive.</p>

<h3>The Three Basic Commands to using the Git command.</h3>
	<p>There are three basic commands when it comes to using Git.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>git add (filename)</li>
			<li>git commit m "Your Commit Message"</li>
			<li>git push origin master</li>
		</ul>

<!--Describing the commands-->
<h3>Git Add</h3>
<div style = text-align:left;><img src="gitadd.PNG" alt="Pic2"></div>
		<p>The git add command is basically arming the file to get ready to be sent to github.com The only way it works is when you have a file ready. If you make directorys and try the git add command it will not work. If you make a directory say: (C:\Users\Andy\NewFile\test.txt). You must be in the directory whwhere the test.txt file is. Then you type in git add test.txt click enter and it will save the file for upload.</p>

<!--Information-->		
<h3> Git Commit -m</h3>
	<div style = text-align:left><img src = "gitcommit.PNG" alt="Pic3"/></div>
		<p>The git commit m command sends a message with the file and the directory to github.com It is important that when you're ready to make a commit or made any modifications its best to leave behind a comment that says what you did. So say in example, I modified a program to do one thing. I would input in my terminal command git commit m "Made a change in program to do math faster" Then you click enter and you will get a prompt that comes up but you can ignore all the stuff that comes up.</p>

<!--Information-->
<h3>Git Push Origin Master</h3>
	<div style = text-align:left><img src= "gitpush.PNG" alt="Pic4"></div>
	<p>The git origin master is what sends all your files and all your commits to github.com. The command pushes the files like guthub desktop and it will ask for your git username and password. When you hit enter after putting in all your information. THe file will upload and will appear on your github repository.</p>
